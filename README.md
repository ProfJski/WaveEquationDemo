# WaveEquationDemo
An intuitive approach to the Schrodinger wave equation using a classical particle, uncertainty and quantization of velocity and/or position, and a histogram.

## Background
I sometimes teach physics concepts to liberal arts students.  The perspective can be rewarding.  In physics textbooks, the approach is often predominated by learning the considerable mathematics -- understandably so.  Yet one sometimes does not see the forest for the trees.  Learning the mathematical methods can detract from considering the principles which inform the mathematics.

Students can struggle with the notion of the Schrodinger Wave Equation as a replacement for classical (Newtonian / Lagrangian) descriptions of the state of a system.  The inspiration for this demo came from a history of science essay (sadly I've lost the citation) which remarked that Schrodinger developed his wave equation from the schoastic mechanics of thermodynamics.  Bing!  I was surprised I hadn't heard that before in any textbook.  So insighful!

## What the Demo does
We represent a classical particle as a small red circle.  It has a definite velocity and position throughout the demo.  Above it, we generate hundreds of other classical particles in white based on our red one.  The position and/or velocity of these particles varies by some random amount from the red one.  Thus we can represent uncertainty about the red particle's precise position and velocity by a "cloud" of white particles plotted above it.  Both the red and white particles move according to the same classical dynamics.

At the botton, a histogram adds up how many particles are in a given position at a certain time.  The wave-like nature of the superposition of the classical particles can readily be seen.  Hopefully this provides an intuitive approach to the wave equation's inspiration.

Simple modifications of the code allow one to vary how the velocity and position of the white particles are arranged around the red one.  The [C++ Random Library](https://www.cplusplus.com/reference/random/) provides a variety of random distributions: uniform linear, Gaussian, etc.  One can vary whether positions and/or velocities are quantized.

## Three views of the data
The initial view shows what was described above: the red "classical particle" (hard to see in the reduced-size image), the white particle cloud, and the blue histogram of particle positions, all of which change with time.  

The system below randomizes position based on a continuous Gaussian distribution around the red particle and randomizes velocity using a uniform distribution quantized into 8 distinct velocities, giving 8 cohorts of bell-curve distributed particles, only one of which corresponds to the red particle.

**Press H** to see a multi-column chart of the position histogram as it has evolved with time.  This more compact view uses brightness of color (from dark red to bright red, then yellow and white) to represent the number of particles in one place at one time.  Every frame of the demo adds a line to this page.  If all columns are filled, additional pages are plotted and you can **press "S" and "W"** to navigate between them.  Each page indicates the timestamp of the starting and ending frame on the left, so you can later zero in on interesting moments in the system.

**Press N** to see a fancy 3D scrolling histogram which basically represents the same data as the previous one, but we make use of the extra dimension to represent the count of particles by height once more.  The display loops through all histogram data.

**Press J** to return to the first view.  

You can also control the frame rate.  **Press +** increase it by 10 FPS.  **Press -** to decrease by 10.  **Press 0** for no frame rate throttling -- it runs as fast as your machine can go.  This mode evolves the system quickly and is useful to amass histogram data -- see below.

The frame rate for the fancy 3D histogram is unfortunately slow, so don't expect much more than 30 FPS for that view.

## OpenCL kernels
Two are provided.  The sinusoidal one is useful because simple harmonic motion is intuitive and a common textbook example.  The "basic" one is a starting point to craft one's own mechanics equations based on a potential field which varies according to position and determines the acceleration on the particle.  To keep the particle within our domain, the basic kernel uses force = -kx^3.  The next step would be to design various potential functions and compare their behavior to the QM equivalent situation.

OpenCL helps if you want to render a large number of particles.  Since they all move independently of each other, they can be updated in parallel.  If one doesn't want OpenCL, the kernel functions can simply be replaced by C++ functions, albeit slower.

## Varying the parameters: some examples
Below is an unrealistic example: simple harmonic motion with 16 quantized velocities but zero uncertainty of position.  Resonances are easily seen but the histogram has very sharp peaks.

In a quantum mechanic system the product of the uncertainty of the momemtum and position would always be greater than Planck's constant, so the uncertainty of velocity should be inversely proportional to the uncertainty of position.  Let's try something better.

The simple harmonic motion system below has 32 different quantized velocities and a continuous Gaussian distribution of uncertainty of position.  The wave-like character of the histogram can still be clearly seen:

A view of its histograms over time models the "fuzzy" state of the particle: the sharp peaks are gone.

The particle's possible position and velocity are spread out over a wider range of values.  Yet the evolution of the whole system is still evident: there are moments when the expectation value of finding the particle int the middle are greater than finding it on the edges, although the latter case generally dominates.  And likewise, there are moments when the expectation value of finding the particle in a certain position are extremely low.
